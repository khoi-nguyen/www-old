title: Welcome
...

Hi everyone!
My name is **Khôi Nguyễn**
and I teach **Mathematics** and **Computer Science**.
I work primarily in secondary schools
but I also lecture part-time
at [NYU Paris](https://nyu.edu/paris.html).
From January onwards,
I will be teaching
[Numerical Analysis](/teaching/nyu/2023-spring-na/)
(MATH-UA 9252) there.

Previously, I worked in international schools such as
the [British School of Brussels](https://britishschool.be)
and [King's College (Soto de Viñuelas)](https://www.madrid-soto.kingscollegeschools.org/en) in Madrid.
And before that, I worked in the Analysis Group at [Imperial College](https://imperial.ac.uk).
My research focused on
[pseudo-differential operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-differential_operator)
on [Lie groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group).
