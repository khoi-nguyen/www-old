::: {.quote title="Albert Einstein about Isaac Newton"}
In order to put his system into mathematical form at all,
Newton had to devise the concept of differential quotients and
propound the laws of motion in the form of **total differential 
equations**â€”perhaps the **greatest advance in thought** that a
single individual was ever privileged to make.

# What's a differential equation? [@zill, p. 3]

::: {.definition title="Differential Equation"}
Equation containing at least one **derivative** (of any order) of an unknown function.

::: example
Newton's law of motion
:
\begin{align*}
\vec F = m \frac {\dd^2 \vec x} {\dd t^2}
\end{align*}

The Laplace Equation
:
\begin{align*}
\frac {\partial^2 V} {\partial x^2}
+ \frac {\partial^2 V} {\partial y^2}
+ \frac {\partial^2 V} {\partial z^2}
= 0
\end{align*}
