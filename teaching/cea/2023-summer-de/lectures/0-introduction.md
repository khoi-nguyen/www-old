::: {.quote title="Albert Einstein about Isaac Newton"}
In order to put his system into mathematical form at all,
Newton had to devise the concept of differential quotients and
propound the laws of motion in the form of **total differential 
equations**â€”perhaps the **greatest advance in thought** that a
single individual was ever privileged to make.
